SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.random
    The 'spatstat.core' package has been divided into two packages,
    called 'spatstat.random' and 'spatstat.core'.
    The new 'spatstat.random' package consists of functions for
    generating random point patterns, and other random spatial data,
    that were originally in 'spatstat.core'.

    o rMatClust, rThomas, rCauchy, rVarGamma
    New argument 'nonempty'

BUG FIXES

    o rmh
    The visual debugger did not display accepted births and deaths correctly.
    [Spotted by Dominic Schuhmacher.]
    Fixed.

    o rmh
    The visual debugger exited prematurely sometimes,
    if the current state was the empty point pattern.
    [Spotted by Dominic Schuhmacher.]
    Fixed.
